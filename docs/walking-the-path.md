### Libraries

Info regarding libraries that are used throughout this course.

#### Matplotlib

It is one of the core Python packages for data visualization and is used by many spatial and non-spatial packages to create charts and maps.

Documentation [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html),
cheat sheets [here](https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/).

Most of the functionality is available in the pyplot submodule. There are two important important objects:

* [Figure](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html): This is the main container of the plot. A figure can contain multiple plots inside it
* [Axes](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html): The Axes class represents one (sub-)plot in a figure. It contains the plotted data, axis ticks, labels, title, legend, etc. Its methods are the main interface for manipulating the plot. 

#### Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. 

User guide [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html#user), absolute basics [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html)

#### Pandas

Useful methods:

**pd.concat**: Concatenate a list of data frames

**df.groupby**: Dataframe method to group by given column
